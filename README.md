# ScrapeNews

This web app will let users see and write comments based off the latest news. 

This app will use the following technologies:
Express, Express-handlebars, Mongoose, Body-parser, Cheerio and Request

Cheerio will grab the site content and Mongoose will save it to a MongoDB database.

Next Version:

- figure out why my scrapes aren't working
- I've tested the code and the code works, so narrowed down the problem to how I'm calling the scrape
- will check spellings and correct terms to pull scrapes after project 3 is finished
